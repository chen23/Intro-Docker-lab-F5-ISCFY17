Connecting to UDF
=================

We consider that you have access to UDF for the different labs

Start your environment
----------------------

If you are running this on your own, find the 'Introduction to Docker' blueprint and deploy it.

.. image:: ../images/Blueprint.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center


Access your environment
-----------------------

Once your environment is started, find the 'win2012' component under 'Components' and launch RDP (in the ACCESS menu)

.. image:: ../images/Launch-RDP.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

Click on the shortcut that got downloaded and it should open your RDP session. The credentials to use are under the Details tab.


.. warning:: For MAC user, it is recommended to use Microsoft Remote Desktop. You may not be able to access your jumpbox otherwise. It is available in the App store (FREE).
